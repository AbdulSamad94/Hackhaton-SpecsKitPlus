# LiDAR for Humanoids

## What is LiDAR?

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) uses laser pulses to measure distances to objects. For humanoids, LiDAR is crucial for:
-   **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: Building a map of the environment.
-   **Obstacle Avoidance**: Detecting walls, people, and furniture.

## Types of LiDAR

1.  **2D LiDAR**: Scans a single plane (e.g., RPLIDAR). Good for flat floors.
2.  **3D LiDAR**: Scans a volume (e.g., Velodyne, Ouster). Essential for humanoids to see overhangs and complex terrain.

## Integrating LiDAR with ROS 2

We typically use the `sensor_msgs/LaserScan` (2D) or `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` (3D) message types.

```bash
# Example: Launching a Velodyne driver
ros2 launch velodyne_driver velodyne_driver_node-VLP16-launch.py
```

## Processing Point Clouds

We use **PCL (Point Cloud Library)** to filter and segment data.

```cpp
// C++ snippet to downsample a point cloud
pcl::VoxelGrid<pcl::PointXYZ> sor;
sor.setInputCloud(cloud);
sor.setLeafSize(0.01f, 0.01f, 0.01f);
sor.filter(*cloud_filtered);
```
