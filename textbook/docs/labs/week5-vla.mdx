# Lab 5: VLA Chat Interface

## Objective
Build a simple chat interface that controls a simulated robot.

## Steps

1.  **Get OpenAI API Key**:
    Sign up for OpenAI and get an API key.
2.  **Create ROS 2 Node**:
    Write a Python node that:
    -   Takes text input from the user.
    -   Sends it to GPT-4 with a system prompt defining available actions.
    -   Parses the response and executes the action (e.g., publish to `/cmd_vel`).
3.  **Test**:
    Type "Move forward" and verify the robot moves.

## Deliverable
The Python script for your chat node.
