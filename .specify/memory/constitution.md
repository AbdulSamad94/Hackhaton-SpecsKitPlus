# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Structured Learning
Each chapter MUST follow a clear structure: explanation → practical example → best practices → hardware/software requirements. This ensures a comprehensive and actionable learning experience.

### Digital + Physical AI Integration
The textbook MUST maintain a clear and consistent structure for integrating digital AI concepts with physical robotics, emphasizing the symbiotic relationship between software and hardware in embodied intelligence.

### Production-Ready Robotics Focus
The content MUST emphasize practical, production-ready robotics knowledge, specifically covering key technologies such as ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, VLA, and Jetson kits. Abstract or purely theoretical discussions should be minimized in favor of applied knowledge.

### Concise Content
The textbook MUST remove unnecessary "fluff" and avoid overly abstract AI-only discussions. The focus is on direct applicability to physical AI and robotics, ensuring every section adds tangible value to the reader's understanding and skill development.

### Consistency in Presentation
The textbook MUST maintain consistent formatting, diagrams, tables, and sample code throughout. This ensures a professional and easily digestible reading experience, reducing cognitive load for the reader.

### Accessibility with Depth
Chapters MUST be accessible for students with varying levels of prior knowledge while still covering advanced robotics and AI concepts with sufficient depth. The goal is to provide a comprehensive learning path for both beginners and those with some experience.

### Weekly Breakdown Alignment
The textbook MUST provide a weekly breakdown of content that aligns with a typical 13-week course syllabus. This helps instructors and students structure their learning over a standard academic term.

### Hardware, Lab, and Cloud Recommendations
The textbook MUST include practical hardware recommendations, detailed lab setup guidelines, and viable cloud alternatives for implementing and experimenting with physical AI and robotics concepts.

### Embodied Intelligence Focus
The textbook MUST focus on embodied intelligence, specifically bridging digital AI theories and practices to physical robot implementations. This principle guides the selection and presentation of all topics, ensuring a strong connection to real-world robotics.

## Key Standards

### Chapter Structure Adherence
All content MUST strictly align with the "Structured Learning" principle for chapters, ensuring each section contributes to a practical understanding of the topic.

### Testable Examples
All practical examples and code provided MUST be testable and runnable, demonstrating concepts effectively on specified target hardware or within simulation environments.

### Standard Robotics Development Practices
The textbook MUST promote and utilize standard practices for robotics development environments, including but not limited to ROS 2 package structure and Gazebo model integration.

### Secure Configuration Practices
The textbook MUST avoid hardcoding sensitive information. Instead, it MUST recommend and demonstrate secure configuration practices for both hardware and software setups in robotics.

## Constraints

### Academic and Industry Relevance
The textbook content MUST be reviewable and usable within standard academic curricula and relevant industry contexts, ensuring its practical value and educational rigor.

### Accessible Platforms
The initial focus MUST be on commonly available and accessible hardware/software platforms (e.g., Jetson kits, free tiers of simulation platforms) to maximize student reach and practical implementation.

### Logical Progression in Weekly Breakdown
Each weekly breakdown MUST logically progress in complexity and topic coverage over the 13 weeks, building foundational knowledge before introducing advanced concepts.

## Success Criteria

### Consistent Chapter Structure
Each chapter consistently adheres to the `explanation → practical example → best practices → hardware/software requirements` structure.

### Clear Digital + Physical AI Integration
Content clearly demonstrates the seamless integration of digital AI with physical robotics.

### Comprehensive Technology Coverage
Specific technologies (ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, VLA, Jetson kits) are adequately covered with practical examples and relevant details.

### Concise and Relevant Content
The textbook is free of superfluous academic jargon and maintains a clear focus on practical application in robotics.

### Uniform Presentation
The formatting, diagrams, tables, and code samples are uniform, easy to understand, and visually appealing throughout the textbook.

### Broad Accessibility with Advanced Depth
The material is comprehensible for students with diverse backgrounds, while advanced robotics and AI concepts are thoroughly explored.

### Actionable 13-Week Syllabus
The 13-week syllabus breakdown provides a clear, actionable, and well-paced learning path.

### Practical Hardware and Lab Guidance
Hardware, lab, and cloud recommendations are practical, actionable, and enhance the hands-on learning experience.

### Strong Embodied Intelligence Focus
The content effectively conveys the principles and applications of embodied intelligence, bridging theory to physical reality.

## Governance
This constitution outlines the core principles and standards for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook" project. Amendments require approval by the project lead. All work must comply with these guidelines.
