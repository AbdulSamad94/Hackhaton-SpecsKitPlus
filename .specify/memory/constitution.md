# Hello World with Docusaurus + Spec-Kit Plus Constitution

## Core Principles

### All pages must render correctly in Docusaurus
Ensures that all content developed within the project is compatible with and correctly displayed by the Docusaurus framework.

### AI-assisted spec must respect project rules
All specifications generated or assisted by AI tools must adhere to the established project guidelines and standards.

### Consistent UI/UX
Maintains a uniform user interface and experience across all pages and components for a cohesive look and feel.

### Clear console logging for errors
Requires comprehensive and understandable error logging in the console to facilitate debugging and issue resolution.

## Key Standards

### Each Spec-Kit generated feature must follow the above rules
Every feature created using Spec-Kit must rigorously comply with the core principles outlined in this constitution.

### Every claim/code must be testable (run locally at least once)
All code and stated functionalities must be verifiable through local execution and testing to ensure correctness.

### Proper folder structure for Docusaurus (pages, components)
Mandates adherence to the recommended Docusaurus folder structure for organizing pages, components, and other assets.

### No hard-coded secrets/API keys
Prohibits the embedding of sensitive information such as secrets or API keys directly into the codebase; secure handling methods must be used.

## Constraints

### Must work on local dev server (npm start)
The project must be fully functional and runnable within a local development environment using `npm start`.

### Use default Docusaurus theme initially
Initially, the project must utilize the default Docusaurus theme to establish a baseline before any custom theming.

### Minimum one working page beyond default homepage
Requires at least one additional functional page to be implemented beyond the standard Docusaurus homepage.

## Success Criteria

### `npm start` runs without errors
Successful execution of the `npm start` command without any reported errors.

### AI-generated code respects folder structure
Code produced by AI tools must correctly integrate into the defined Docusaurus folder hierarchy.

### Hello World renders correctly in browser
The 'Hello World' content must display accurately and without issues in a web browser.

## Governance
This constitution outlines the core principles and standards for the "Hello World with Docusaurus + Spec-Kit Plus" project. Amendments require approval by the project lead. All work must comply with these guidelines.
